# Wow, population size helps a lot! But those curve look dreadful.(4.3102)
# I am thinking should I change the tournament size back to 5? The larger that size, the more opportunity good individuals can get.
# Yes I am just too lazy and don't want to add the elitism part.
# Finally I change it to 10.
